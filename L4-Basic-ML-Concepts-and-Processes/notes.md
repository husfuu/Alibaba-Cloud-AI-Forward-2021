# Machine Learning
* Arthur Samuel (1959). **Machine Learning** is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
    * Take mail classification as an example
        * E | Watching your label emails as spam or not spam
        * T | Classifying emails as spam or not spam
        * P | The number of emails correctly classified as spam/ not spam

* **Collect Data**: the quality and quantity of collected data will directly determine whether the prediction model can be built.
* **Train Model**: Iterate many times until performance is acceptable.
* **Evaluate Model**:

* **Deploy Model**: Deploy into a production environment
