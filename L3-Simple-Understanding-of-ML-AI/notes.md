## The Concept of Artificial Intelligence
* The birth of artificial intelligence
   * John McCarthy
   * Dartmouth Conference

* **The concepts of AI: AI is a computer program that makes reasonable actions and obtains the maximum benefits according to the perception of the environment.
    * Systems that think like humans
    * Systems that think rationally
    * Systems that act like humans
    * Systems that act like rationally

## Three Schools of AI
* **Symbolism** | logicism, psychology school orcomputer school<br>
The essence is to simulate abstract logic thinking of human brain, by studying the function mechanism of human cognition system, to describe human cognition process with some symbol, and to imitate human cognition process by inputting the symbol into the computer that can handle symbols, in a nutshell, “cognition is calculation”.
* **Connectionism** | bionics or physiology school <br>
Its main principle is the neural network and the connection mechanism and learning algorithm among neural networks, which is mainly represented by deep learning.
* **Behaviorism (Actionism)** | evolutionism or cybernetics <br>
Its principle is control theory and perceptual-action control system, which is mainly represented by enhanced learning method with reward and punishment control mechanism. Its enhanced learning can be used to accumulate learning performance based on the gain and loss in interaction, which is similar to the real learning mechanism of human beings

## The Classification of AI
* Artificial Narrow Intelligence <br>
Only care about the result, not the process of thinking
* Artificial General Intelligence <br>
Not only about the result, but also understanding the "thinking" process.
